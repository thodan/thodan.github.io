specular reflection from image sequences, to find their limitations and to suggest possibilities
of their improvements. Particularly, an attention was paid to planar specular (i.e. mirror-
like) surfaces whose appearance can be modeled by linear superposition of reflection and
transmission layer. We reviewed the existing motion-based methods and described their
common degenerate case in terms of their disability to correctly recover regions with low
frequency in the direction of camera motion. A new method designed to eliminate this
degenerate case was suggested. Its contribution is a new approach to layer gradients esti-
mation with a special treatment of the gradients forming edges of the problematic regions.
The estimated layer gradients, together with estimated layer depth maps, are then used for
recovery of layer colors which can be treated as a quadratic programming problem or can be
done by a more efficient alternative approach which we introduced. The suggested method
was shown to outperform the existing methods, especially in the problematic regions.},
