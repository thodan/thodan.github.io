annote =      {Learning, detecting and accurately localizing texture-less
	       objects is a common requirement for applications in both
	       personal and industrial robotics. Despite their ubiquitous
	       presence, texture-less objects present significant
	       challenges to contemporary methods for visual object
	       detection and localization. In our work we aim at
	       simultaneous detection of multiple texture-less objects
	       with sub-linear complexity in the number of known objects,
	       real time performance, robustness to occlusion and clutter,
	       low false detection rate, and accurate object localization.
	       So far, we have proposed two methods. One method works with
	       both color and depth features. It adopts the sliding window
	       paradigm with an efficient cascade-style evaluation of each
	       window location. The method can run in real-time, achieves
	       the state of the art performance, and its practical
	       relevance was demonstrated in a real robotic application.
	       In the other proposed method, which works only with image
	       edges, we focused on efficient generation of detection
	       hypotheses based on constellations of short edge segments.
	       Experimental evaluation proved the method to be faster and
	       more robust than the method of Damen et al.~(2012), on
	       which our method is based. The method was also shown to be
	       suitable to support an augmented reality application for
	       assembly guidance. Besides, we have created a new RGB-D
	       dataset which will be used for a challenge at ICCV 2015
	       workshop. This document describes the topic in more detail,
	       reviews related work, presents our contributions and
	       introduces open issues and goals of the thesis.},
