# <span id="about"></span> About me

I am a Staff Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/) in Zurich. My research is focused on 3D computer vision, mostly on the detection, pose estimation, tracking, and reconstruction of objects and hands, which are important topics for AR/VR and robotics applications. Prior to joining Meta in 2020, I received my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Jiri Matas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EJCNY6QAAAAJ) at the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://fel.cvut.cz/). During my PhD, I visited [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) in Redmond and [Google](http://www.stefan-hinterstoisser.com/) in Munich as an intern. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's (with honours) degree in computer science from the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en). I am co-organizing the [BOP benchmark](https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/) and [R6D workshops](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/sixd/workshop_2024/), and serve as a reviewer/area chair at academic conferences. I received the Rector's Prize for an outstanding PhD thesis and the Dean's Prize for an excellent Master's thesis.
