## <span id="about"></span> About me

I&nbsp;am a Staff Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/) (2020--2023 in Seattle, from 2023 in Zurich). My research focuses on spatial AI and deep learning for AR/VR and robotics, particularly on the detection, pose estimation, and reconstruction of objects and hands. Prior to joining Meta in 2020, I&nbsp;received my PhD in computer vision under the supervision of [Prof. Jiri Matas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EJCNY6QAAAAJ) at the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://fel.cvut.cz/), during which I&nbsp;interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) and [Google](http://www.stefan-hinterstoisser.com/). Previously, I&nbsp;earned my Master’s degree with honours from the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en). Beyond my research, I&nbsp;organize the [BOP benchmark](https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/) and [R6D workshops](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/sixd/workshop_2024/) on object pose estimation and serve as an Area Chair at top-tier academic conferences. My work has been recognized with the Rector’s Prize for an outstanding PhD thesis and the Dean’s Prize for an excellent Master’s thesis.
