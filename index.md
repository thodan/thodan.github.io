## <span id="about"></span> About me

I am a Staff Research Scientist at [Meta](https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/) in Zurich. My research is focused on 3D computer vision and deep learning, mostly on the detection, pose estimation and reconstruction of objects and hands, which are important topics for AR/VR and robotics. Prior to joining Meta in 2020, I received my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Jiri Matas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EJCNY6QAAAAJ) at the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://fel.cvut.cz/). During my PhD, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/) and [Google](http://www.stefan-hinterstoisser.com/). Prior to that, I obtained my Master's degree (with honours) in computer science from the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.fit.vut.cz/.en). I am organizing the [BOP benchmark](https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/) and [R6D workshops](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/sixd/workshop_2024/), and serve as an area chair at top-tier academic conferences. I received the Rector's Prize for an outstanding PhD thesis and the Dean's Prize for an excellent Master's thesis.
